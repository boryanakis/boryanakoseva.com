### Purpose of the Workshop

This is meant to be a hands-on short workshop for people who are interested in creating a personal website within RSudio. It is meant for users familiar with R and RStudio. The pesonal website will consist of static but modern webpages generated by `blogdown`. The website can be hosted on Github, and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Don't worry if this sounds foreign right now. 

### Products

At the end of the workshop, you will have a basic webpage that you can further customize outside the workshop. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to install/update the software on your computer. For details, see the [installation details](tutorials/blogdown/software_mac/). 
In creating the content for this workshop (and the online tutorial), I have made some assumptions about you:

1. You have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) and you know your password
2. You are familiar with `R`, RStudio and, at least, vaguely familiar with RStudio Projects
3. You have heard of `Markdown` or `R markdown`
4. You can install/update software on your computer

### Pre-workshop Homework

Please follow the instllation/update instructions for [Mac](tutorials/blogdown/software_mac/) and [Windows](tutorials/blogdown/software_windows/).
