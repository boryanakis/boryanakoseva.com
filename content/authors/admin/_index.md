I am a bioinformatics specialist at the Kansas Idea Network for Biomedical Reseach Excellence (K-INBRE) Bioinformatics Core at the Univ. of Kansas. My interests revolve around analysis of sequencing data, genomic workflows, and pipeline automation.

In my spare time, I play board games :game_die:, cuddle my dogs :dog::dog:, and gush about butterflies :butterfly:.
